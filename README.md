# dwm - dynamic window manager

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

Vanilla dwm is fine by itself unlike st and shit like that.
This is why this repo is pointless already.

Well...not that pointless because I still use it to tweak aesthetic stuff.

Also It does not have _wm specific_ ways to do general things.
I mean, if it is possible to bind on xbindkeys or sxhkd (later preferred) it is not in the keybindings for my build.
