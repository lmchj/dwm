# dwm - dynamic window manager
## nndwmblm - no nonsense dynamic window manager build (by) lm

dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

### Features
- Just the features of dwm, why do you need something else.
- It does not have _wm specific_ ways to do things.
I mean, if it is possible to bind on xbindkeys or sxhkd (later preferred) it is not in the keybindings for my build.

### Patches applied

**NONE**

Vanilla dwm is fine by itself unlike st and shit like that.
